# Threat modeling templates

## This repository contains templates for threat modeling.

**Why?**

Threat modeling is sometimes hard and it's not that simple to do, we aim to change that
by offering simple templates with included instructions to make sure that everyone knows how to threat model correctly.

**Goals:**

- Making threat modeling easier
- Allow making your own custom threat model
- Allow combinations too
- Our priority should always be quality and precise information rather than quantity

**Contributing:**

If you make your own custom threat model and think other people might benefit from it, please make a PR.


**File formats we aim to support:**

- Markdown (MD)
- ODT
- PDF/A
