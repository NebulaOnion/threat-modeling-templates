This document contains templates for threat modeling.

Why?

Threat modeling is sometimes hard and it's not that simple to do, we aim to change that
by offering simple templates with included instructions to make sure that everyone knows how to threat model correctly.

Goals:

- Making threat modeling easier
- Allow making your own custom threat model
- Allow combinations too

Contributing:

If you make your own custom threat model and think other people might benefit from it, please make a PR
