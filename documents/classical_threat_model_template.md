## How to use this template:

This threat modeling template is basic, and therefore we suggest for everyone to use it and fill it. To use it correctly, you just need to fill out all of the questions, however, make sure you write them with thorough answers, think every way you can be compromised and write it in the appropriate question response.

**Explanation of the questions:**

- **What do I want to protect?**: this defines all of your assets that you desire to protect, we usually call "assets" all of your property, like a phone you own, your house, even yourself. This is very important because protecting every asset against attacks is very costly, you have to analyze what you are exposed to and plan according to that.

- **Who do I want to protect it against?**: the answer to this question defines something we call your adversary, an adversary is an entity (a group of people or a person) that wants to break your threat model and gain unauthorized access to your assets. For example, if you want to protect a house, thieves are one of your adversaries because they want to access your home without your approval.

- **How likely is it that I will need to protect it?**: this is the risk that an attack towards your threat model and property will succeed, to know this, you need to know the circumstances and the things around it, for example, continuing with the house and the thief example, if home invasions are frequent within your neighborhood, the risk that a thief breaks into your house is higher than a house sitting on a very quiet and peaceful neighborhood. *As you can see, if your risk is higher, you'll need to put more focus and resources on securing that asset.*

- **How bad are the consequences if I fail to protect my assets?**: this will depend on a lot of factors, for instance, let's say you posses cryptocurrency), let's also say that it's banned on your jurisdiction. If you get caught, you could face very **serious consequences** including fines and even jail time. 
  
  But if someone is on a jurisdiction where cryptocurrency is legal, the consequences of failing are much lower, if not zero. Some people in the privacy community think of it as a game, because they don't like companies monetizing their data, and therefore there aren't much consequences to failing. But for some, privacy is what **guarantees their safety.**

- **How much trouble am I willing to go through to protect my assets?**: this defines your relationship between convenience and mitigating risks, to put an example, you have a laptop without any kind of password, it's very convenient, you just turn it on and start using it but, it's not very secure because infecting it with malware when you are absent is relatively easy. 
  
  Now let's say that you introduce a user password, it's more secure because installing malware while your computer is locked is harder but not impossible, but now you need to carry the password on your mind, make sure you don't forget it and remember to lock the screen every time you leave the computer.
  
  As we can see, the relationship between convenience and risk mitigation is inverse, the more risks you mitigate, the less convenient it is. By using a computer, you are giving up some amount of privacy and security to the convenience of using it. **The difficult part is finding a balance**, that only depends on you and to the extend you want or need to protect your assets.
  
  <u>Below you can find several examples of this.</u>

## **EXAMPLE (Journalist who desires to stay anonymous)**

1. **What assets do I want to protect?**

I want to protect mainly against my identity being discovered as a journalist, specially the cases in which I've worked on.

2. **Who do I want to protect it against?**

Mostly against my family and friends because I wouldn’t want them to know that I’m a journalist.

3. **How likely is it that I will need to protect it?**

My friends and family are mildly curious *(have little resources)* and they respect my privacy.

4. **How bad are the consequences if I fail to protect my assets?**

If my identity were to be breached I would be very ashamed but my life wouldn’t be in any danger.

5. **How much trouble am I willing to go through to protect my assets?**

*(Use the information written on the previous questions to answer this one)* 

I’m willing to sacrifice attribution to my real name for my cases and to write and document information under a pseudonym.
