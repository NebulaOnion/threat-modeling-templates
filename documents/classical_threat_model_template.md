## **EXAMPLE (Journalist who desires to stay anonymous)**

1. *What do I want to
   protect?*

I want to protect
mainly against my identity being discovered as a journalist,
specially the cases in which I've worked on.

2. *Who do I want to
   protect it against?*

Mostly against my
family and friends because I wouldn’t want them to know that I’m
a journalist.

3. *How likely is it
   that I will need to protect it?*

My friends and
family are mildly curious *(have little resources)* and
they respect my privacy.

4. *How bad are the
   consequences if I fail?*

If
my identity were to be breached I would be very ashamed but my life
wouldn’t be in danger.

5. *How much trouble
   am I willing to go through to try to prevent potential consequences?*

*(Use information
written on the previous questions to answer this one)* I’m
willing to sacrifice attribution to
my real name for my cases and
to write and document information under a pseudonym.
