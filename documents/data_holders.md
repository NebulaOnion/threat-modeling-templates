## How to use this template:

We suggest for everyone to fill in this template because it can aid in choosing what threat model you should use, and to tailor it to your needs.



To use this template, fill in all the gaps with all of the information that you can gather, every time you hand data to some entity, you should update this document, 

although, that will depend on your threat model but we regardless suggest everybody to update it regularly, you can also set a remainder to update this every week/month/year.

Explanation of the fields:

- **Data entity:** the entity you provide data to, for example, if you use WhatsApp, it would be Facebook (Meta).

- **Data given:** this is the data you handed over to this entity, if you used false information, you should still list it and say that you employed false information for those data points. On LINDDUN threat models this is commonly called "Inbound data flow".

- **Privacy policy information:** this is all of the information that their privacy policy tells you, you should request privacy policy every time you provide data to an entity to fill in that gap. Pertinent information that goes into this field could be data retention period, whether they share that data with third parties and so on...

- **Privacy and security concerns:** the concerns that you extracted while using the service to put an example, if you signed up with a loyalty service and provided your ID, a concern could be "Unredacted ID copy could be leaked".

- **Privacy risk:** a number from zero to ten representing the risk that the entity poses a threat to your privacy, this would grow with the number of (real) data given, privacy concerns and more. <u>*TODO: make a list of the data that can be provided and create an objective system to measure and calculate the score.*</u>

- **Security risk:** a number from zero to ten representing the risk that the entity poses a threat to your security, this would grow with the number of (real) data given (due to risks of data breaches), security concerns and the less amount of security that a system has. <u>*TODO: make a list of the data that can be provided and create an objective system to measure and calculate the score.*</u>

- **Anonymity risk:** a number from zero to ten representing the risk that the entity poses a threat to your anonymity, this is usually the mean of the security risk and the anonymity risk, though not always. <u>*TODO: elaborate more on this.*</u>
